# RPSgame
Inspired by the Rock Paper Scissors Simulation on Youtube, I tried to code my own version. 

## Features 
- Full GUI (gorgeous)
- Threaded so you can run up to 10,000 bots at the same time (smoothish on ryzen 3700)
- Bars to track the relative numbers of each team (neat)

## Classes
- Creature.java - Represents one bot, used to manage storing the bot's location and team
- CreatureViewerPanel.java - Custom JPanel for rendering bot icons to the screen
- RPSSim.java - Runs all the simulation's calculations
- SimViewer.java - Swing GUI built with NetBeans' GUI builder
